Along with being a passionate computer scientist, I really enjoy mechanical keyboards and use a Planck keyboard every day. After all, a programmer is only as good as their tools, and the keyboard is my main one.<br>Mechanical keyboards are great because they last very long, are customizable, and are getting cheaper and more mainstream with each passing day. In particular, the Planck is excellent because its unique layout reduces finger strain and movement. I wrote this guide to spread my passion for mechanical keyboards and introduce new people to the topic in the hopes that they will go on to use and reap the rewards of mechanical keyboards as I have done. Sometimes it can be intimidating to work with hardware, especially when it's uncommon. I hope that this guide helps to make this subject and the hardware itself much more approachable. Furthermore, the Planck is simple to assemble; it can be done in about 20 minutes and requires only basic tools and no soldering or wiring.<br>If you are interested in learning about mechanical keyboards, ortholinear layouts, the Planck, or have one and want to assemble it, I highly recommend giving this a read.<br></p><hr><p class="card-text"><p>You can find the PDF for this assembly guide by clicking on the page below.</p><p><a href='/assets/planck.pdf'><img src="/assets/planck.png" alt="Assembling the Planck Keyboard" title= "Assembling the Planck Keyboard" /></a></p></p></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
