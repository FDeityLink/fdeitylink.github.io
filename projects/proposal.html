This would involve designing a custom Lisp programming language and a four week course for new Computer Science students to learn introductory computer science through Lisp.<br>Although I have yet to actually perform research in this topic, I hope to complete a Master's thesis in the future with a focus in programming language theory. This proposal could serve as a valuable jumping-off point for preparing a full thesis proposal. As I am passionate about Lisp programming and its power, I do hope that my thesis focuses on it in some way.<br>This may give you ideas for similar research that you could perform, or inspire you to learn about the benefits of Lisp if you are unaware (take a look at my blog for an introduction!) so please give it a read if you are interested!<br></p><hr><p class="card-text"><p>You can find the PDF for this proposal by clicking on the page below.</p><p><a href='/assets/proposal.pdf'><img src="/assets/proposal.png" alt="Introducing Programming through Lisp" title= "Introducing Programming through Lisp" /></a></p></p></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
