I'm Brian "FDeityLink" Christian. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p><p>I am a third-year Computer Science major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I have programmed professionally since 2014 and have worked on a wide variety of projects. Some of these deal with distributed systems, mobile device networking, mock data generation, formal language theory, compiler design, and more. You can find my GitHub repositories <a href='https://github.com/fdeitylink?tab=repositories'>here</a>.</p><p>My primary interests include programming languages, compilers and interpreters, functional programming, and computer science theory. I have used a wide variety of languages, including Java, Kotlin, and Clojure. I am hoping to learn more about Haskell, Rust, and Scala in the future as I am a functional programming zealot.</p><p>I also enjoy other kinds of technology in general, such as video gaming, mechanical keyboards (I use a <a href='https://olkb.com/collections/planck'>Planck</a>), and Linux (<a href='https://archlinux.org/'>I use Arch Linux </a>). I don't have as much to write about or work on in this subjects, but I keep myself updated and spend some time with these subjects in my free time.</p><p>I write on occasion too, as you can see throughout this website. Most of the projects I have displayed on this portfolio are writing projects, even the ones with a significant amount of programming. Blogging is one of my preferred formats to read and write; it's a great way to write about any topic of your choosing with your own author's voice. Since it's published on the web, you can also get a high degree of control over how the blog is formatted and presented.</p></div></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
